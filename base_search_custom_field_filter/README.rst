This module allows to define custom filters in the search views for an specific
field belonging to the document or any other related document.

This nature makes the definition quite technical, but once done, it adds the
element in the UI for regular user use.

Configuration
=============

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > User Interface > Custom Field Filters*.
#. Create a new record, and define following information:

   * The **Model** for which you are defining the filter. It will appear in all
     the search views of this model.
   * The label you want to see on the search line on the **Name** field. This
     field allows translations for proper UI in different languages.
   * The **Expression**, which is the field chain string with dot notation.
     Examples: `product_id`, `product_id.seller_ids.name`, `partner_id.lang`.
   * Optionally, you can fill **Position After** for indicating after which
     existing field (technical name) the filter will appear. If empty or not
     found, the filter will be added at the end.
#. You can reorder records for determining sorting for multiple filters for the
   same model with the arrow handle in the left part.

Usage
=====

#. Go to the menu entry for which you have defined the custom field filter.
#. On the search bar, type anything.
#. In the filter list, you will see the line for the element you have defined.

As demo data, a custom field filter is included for sample purposes:

Steps for trying this sample:

#. Install `contacts` module.
#. Go to *Contacts*.
#. Type "english" and you'll find the filter "Language" at the end:
