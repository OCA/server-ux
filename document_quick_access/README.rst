This module allows to search any kind of records through a launcher.
With this, we can add a QR in our reports in order to search elements faster.
It could be used to add this QR (on a label) on external documents.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

# Access on developer mode
# Access `Settings > Technical > Document Quick Access`
# Create a record selecting the model, format and priority

Usage
=====

# Click on the QR button upper right in the navbar or access to it with `Alt + Shift + Q`
# A Pop up will be opened. You can scan a QR / barcode
# If the QR / barcode is found, you will be redirected to the record view

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* It would be interesting to be able to read the QR without clicking the button.
  Maybe using a shortcut or directly accessing it.
