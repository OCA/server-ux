This module provide abstract models to manage overdue reminder.
overdue reminder to be applied on different models (invoices, expense advance, ...).

example:
--------

* for the expense advance overdue date and not clearing.
* We can also send mail or print letter when the overdue date.

**Note:** To be able to use this module in a new model you will need some
development. It is not useful for itself. You can see an example of implementation
in the 'hr_expense_advance_overdue_reminder' module. (hr-expense repository).
