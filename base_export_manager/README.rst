This module extends the export capability:

1. It allows an admin to manage export profiles (``ir.exports``) that
   Odoo stores internally but does not show anywhere.
2. It also adds a new column to access rights to enable/disable export and
   override the export method to check if the user is allowed to export. Export
   is enabled by default.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

* Activate the developer mode
* Go to Settings > Users & Companies > Groups to select a user group
* Edit the group and go to the Access Rights tab
* Uncheck the "Export Access" box on the object of your choice and save

You can also go to Settings > Technical > Security > Access Rights.

Usage
=====

You can create the export profiles as you are used to:

* Go to any list view.
* Check some records.
* Press *Action > Export*.
* Use the wizard to choose the columns to export.
* Press *Save fields list*.
* Give it a name.
* Press *OK*.

To manage export profiles, you need to:

* Go to *Settings > Technical > User Interface > Export Profiles*.
* Create a new one.
* Choose a name.
* Choose a model (table in the database).
* Choose the fields to export.

  * If you choose a related field, you can choose also up to 4 levels of
    subfields.
  * You can drag & drop to reorder the fields.

To use one of those profiles, you need to:

* Go to any list view.
* Check some records.
* Press *Action > Export*.
* Choose your saved export from *Saved exports*.
* Press *Export to file*.

Once you have configured groups who cannot export an object:

* Connect as a user of this group
* Go to the list view of the object you disabled the export
* Select records and open the Action menu. The "Export" is not there.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Translated labels are not used in final exported file.
