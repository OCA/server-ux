Configuration
=============

After installation of this module, every employee can still access technical
features for the applications that they have access to by enabling debug mode.
Additionally, users can check the *Technical feature* field in their
preferences to gain permanent access to the menus and views that fall under
this category.

Upon installation of this module, this preference is already
set for the administrator user of the database.

In the background, this preference is mapped to the *Technical feature (w/o
debug mode)* group that this module adds. As an administrator, you can
therefore manage this preference from the regular Users and Groups menu items.
f it's not unique.
