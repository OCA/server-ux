#. Go to *Settings > Custom Filters*.
#. Create a new Custom Filter, and define following information:

   * The **Model** for which you are defining the filter.
   * The **Type** depending on whether you want to add a filter or a grouping by
     by a field.
   * The **Domain** that will be applied with the filter.
   * The **Group By Field** used to perform the group by.
   * The **Group** to have filters under the same separator.

#. You can reorder records from the list view with the arrow handle. This will
   determine the order in which they appear in the filters/groupby menu.
#. A separator is added between each custom filter added. You can create Custom
   Filter Groups to group filters that you want to have displayed under the same
   separator.
