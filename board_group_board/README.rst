Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Settings / Technical / Group dashboard
2. Create a record for each group you want to impose a dashboard on
3. Note that users will be assigned the first board with a matching
   group, so move i.e. manager groups before user groups

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Settings / Technical / Group dashboard
2. On some dashboard, click 'Impose on all users', this will create a
   dashboard for all users of the groups listed on the group dashboard
3. New users will receive the dashboard of their group

Note that while users are able to customize their boards as they see
fit, they'll lose all customization once you impose a dashboard again,
either by clicking the button or by a group assignment for this user.
