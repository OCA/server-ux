To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Settings / Technical / Group dashboard
2. On some dashboard, click 'Impose on all users', this will create a dashboard for all users of the groups listed on the group dashboard
3. New users will receive the dashboard of their group

Note that while users are able to customize their boards as they see fit, they'll lose all customization once you impose a dashboard again, either by clicking the button or by a group assignment for this user.
