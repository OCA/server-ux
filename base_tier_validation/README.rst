This module does not provide a functionality by itself but an abstract model
to implement a validation process based on tiers on other models (e.g.
purchase orders, sales orders...).

**Note:** To be able to use this module in a new model you will need some
development.

See `purchase_tier_validation <https://github
.com/OCA/purchase-workflow>`_ as an example of implementation.

   functionality.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Starting with Odoo v11 it would be interesting to try to take advantage of ``mail.activity.mixin``.
