Delegating some operations is a common need across different areas in a company.
With this module you will be able to define delegations for some models.

This module does not provide a functionality by itself but an abstract model
to implement a delegation process based on tiers on other models (e.g.
purchase orders, sales orders, budgets, expenses...).

**Note:** To be able to use this module in a new model you will need some
development.
