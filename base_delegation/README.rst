Delegating some operations is a common need across different areas in a company.
With this module you will be able to define delegations for some models.

This module does not provide a functionality by itself but an abstract model
to implement a delegation process based on tiers on other models (e.g.
purchase orders, sales orders, budgets, expenses...).

**Note:** To be able to use this module in a new model you will need some
development.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Delegations*.
#. Create as many delegations as you want for any model having delegation enabled (you would need specific module per model)
   with start and end date (optional).

**Note:**

* If no end date is defined then delegation remains valid forever.
