This module allows to edit several records at the same time in any Odoo model

**Difference in comparison to the Odoo Feature**

- Possibility to mass edit many fields in a single action
- Possibility to add a group to limit the usage of this function to
  given people
- Possibility to filter the items the user can mass update
- Possibility to mass edit any fields with any widget. (For exemple
  color fields, image fields, etc...)
