This module allows to swap the value of a field and propagate it in a chained
way to linked records. Example: changing the delivery address in a confirmed
sales order, it should be changed in its delivery orders as well.

It also allows to apply constraints for not allowing to do that change
according rules, so the business logic is not broken. Example: Don't allow
to change the delivery address if the delivery order is validated.

This module requires some technical knowledge for setting the chained swap and
the constraint, as it's defined through technical names and Python code.

**WARNING**: Use this module with care, as it can screw up database consistency
if swaps are not properly designed .

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Setting > Field Swaps > Field Swaps*.
#. Create a new object and set the following data as an example:

   * Name for identifying it and use it for the action name.
   * Select the source model where the swap will be started.
   * Select the starting field for which the swap will be done.
   * Add several chained fields. They are expressed as a string using
     dot notation, taking the source model as beginning for looking there
     the first field, and continuing from there drilling through. Example:
     `picking_ids.partner_id` for `sale.order` model will go to the linked
     deliveries orders, and change the customer there.
   * Add possible constraints for restricting the chained swap. They are
     Python expressions that must be one line that is evaluated as boolean.
     If the evaluation is true, then a message will be thrown and no swap
     will be allowed. You can use the variable `records` in your code, that
     will be referring the selected records for doing the swap. Example: for
     restricting sales orders that have a delivery order validated:

     `any(p.state == 'done' for p in records.mapped('picking_ids.state'))`

     Other variables you can use are `env`, `date` and `datetime`.
     Each constraint has a name for identifying it, but also for showing that
     name when displaying the error trying to do the swap.

#. Click on 'Add action' smart button to add a new action in the source model.

On demo databases, you can check the example "Language", that changes the
language of a contact, and propagate it to children contacts.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to the source document in list mode.
#. Select one or several records.
#. Click on Action and locate the option "Chained swap: <name of the swap>".
#. If one of the selected records doesn't comply with one of the constraints,
   a message will be shown, and the swap won't continue.
#. If everything is OK, a popup will arise, and you will see a field for
   filling the new value.
#. Click on "Change", and the swap will be done.
#. On the chatter of the source document, an entry will be logged for
   reflecting the done swap.
