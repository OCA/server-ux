To share a filter among several users you need to:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > User Interface > User-defined Filters*.
#. Edit a filter and fill the fields *Available for users* and/or *Available
   for groups* with the desired users/groups.
#. The matched users will find the filter available as any other custom filter
   under favorites in the search panel. However only the owner will be able to
   delete the filter.
