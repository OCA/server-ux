This module allows you to automate the periodic duplication of a document (sale order, purchase order, invoice or any other document). It is useful to generate recurring invoices, recurring orders, etc. Note that you can also use the *contract* module from `the OCA contract project <https://github.com/OCA/contract>`_ to manage recurring invoices; the *contract* module has many more features that this *subscription* module, but the *subscription* module can generate any kind of documents, not only invoices.

This module was part of the official addons up to Odoo Community v10 and was removed from Odoo Community in v11. This is a port of the module from Odoo Community v10.
